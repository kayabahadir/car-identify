# IAP Troubleshooting Guide - TestFlight Issue

## 🚨 Current Problem
- TestFlight build shows "Purchase successful!" but Apple payment screen doesn't open
- Credits are not being added
- Running in mock mode instead of real IAP

## 🔍 Debug Steps Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed console logs in `IAPService.js`
- Added environment detection in `PurchaseScreen.js`
- Added diagnostics display in error cases

### 2. Debug Information to Check

When you test in TestFlight, check console logs for:

```
🔍 IAP Environment Check:
- InAppPurchases module: true/false
- Platform: ios
- Is device: true/false
- Is simulator: false
- App ownership: standalone (should be this in TestFlight)
- Is Expo Go: false

🔍 Checking IAP availability...
✅ InAppPurchases module is loaded
🔄 IAP not initialized, initializing...
✅ IAP initialized successfully
🔍 Checking IAP availability with isAvailableAsync...
📊 IAP availability result: true/false

🛍️ Loading IAP products...
📦 Product IDs to load: [array of IDs]
📊 getProductsAsync raw result: [result object]
✅ Successfully loaded products count: 0/1/2/3
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues

### 1. App Store Connect Configuration
- **Products not approved**: Check if IAP products are "Ready for Sale"
- **Bundle ID mismatch**: Verify bundle ID matches exactly
- **IAP not enabled**: Check if In-App Purchases capability is enabled

### 2. TestFlight Limitations
- **Sandbox environment**: TestFlight uses sandbox, products must be configured for sandbox
- **Test user**: Must be logged in with sandbox test user account

### 3. Product Configuration Issues
Product IDs being used:
- `com.caridentify.app.credits.pack10`
- `com.caridentify.app.credits.pack50`
- `com.caridentify.app.credits.pack200`

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Check App Store Connect
1. Go to App Store Connect → Your App → Features → In-App Purchases
2. Verify all 3 products exist and are "Ready for Sale"
3. Check product IDs match exactly (case sensitive)
4. Verify products are marked as "Consumable"

### 2. Check TestFlight Test User
1. Settings → App Store → Sandbox Account
2. Make sure you're logged in with a sandbox test user
3. If not, create one in App Store Connect → Users and Access → Sandbox Testers

### 3. Test with Debug Info
1. Install updated build with enhanced logging
2. Try purchase and check console logs
3. If IAP not available, tap "Test Mock Purchase" to verify credit system works
4. Share the debug info from the alert

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Force Real IAP (if module loads but fails)
If `InAppPurchases` module loads but `isAvailable()` returns false, we can try forcing the purchase anyway.

### Option 2: Temporary Mock Mode Toggle
Add a hidden debug button to toggle between real and mock IAP for testing.

### Option 3: Fallback Strategy
Implement a fallback that tries real IAP first, then falls back to mock if it fails.

## 📱 Next Steps

1. **Test current build** with enhanced logging
2. **Check console output** for detailed IAP status
3. **Verify App Store Connect** product configuration
4. **Share debug info** from the alert dialog

The enhanced logging will tell us exactly where the IAP flow is failing.
